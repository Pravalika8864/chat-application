This project is a real-time private chat application designed to facilitate one-on-one communication between users in a seamless and interactive
web environment. Built using a modern technology stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express and Socket.IO
on the backend, the app enables users to log in with a username, view a dynamic list of online users, and engage in private messaging with selected
individuals. When a user enters their name and joins the chat, their identity is registered with the server, and their presence is broadcast to all
connected users in real-time. The chat interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use, featuring a clear layout that separates the user list
from the message window. Upon clicking a username in the user list, the chat area updates to display the private conversation with that particular 
user. This ensures that messages are exchanged privately and are not broadcast to the entire room, distinguishing this app from group chat platforms.

The integration of Socket.IO enables real-time communication without refreshing the page, ensuring that users receive new messages instantly. When a
private message is sent, it is tagged with the sender's name and a timestamp, providing context and improving the readability of the conversation. 
The server handles all socket connections, maintains a list of active users, and routes messages to the correct recipient based on socket IDs. The 
backend also dynamically updates the user list whenever someone joins or leaves the chat, ensuring an accurate real-time user display. The frontend
interface is styled using CSS to offer a clean and modern look, with active users highlighted and chat messages displayed in a scrollable window. 
The application also handles edge cases such as trying to send a message without selecting a user or trying to join without a name, enhancing the 
robustness of the experience.

This chat application serves as an ideal learning project for understanding real-time communication, event-driven architecture, and full-stack web development. 
It also lays the groundwork for more advanced features such as message persistence, user authentication, typing indicators, read receipts, or even group chats. 
The modular structure and clear separation between client-side and server-side logic make it easy to extend and maintain. Overall, this project showcases how to
build a fully functional, real-time, private messaging platform using modern web technologies.
